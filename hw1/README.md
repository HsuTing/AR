# Homework 1

## Requirement:

- Use OpenCV to detect faces and eyes captured by your web-cam or mobile device.
- Use OpenCV (CAMshift) to track the face captured by your web-cam or mobile device (only the first-time appearing face is detected, the same face in the following frames should be tracked rather than being detected)
